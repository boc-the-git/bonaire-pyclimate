# bonaire-pyclimate
Reverse engineered python implementation of the Bonaire MyClimate app

## Quick notes
- This is in no way affiliated with Bonaire or their associates
- This comes as-is, use at your own risk
- This has been written and tested with AppDaemon 4.0.3
- This has only been tested within my own home
- This is local only control, avoids Bonaire cloud but your device must be on the same local LAN.
- Your network must support UDP broadcast.
- You must update '_remote_address' and '_local_address' with the IP address of your Bonaire WiFi module and the device initiating this connection
- Fan mode is experimental at this stage
